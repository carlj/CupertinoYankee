# A Cupertino Yankee in Scott Forstall's Court

**An NSDate Category With Locale-Aware Calculations for Beginning, End, Next & Previous of Day, Week, Month, and Year**

> **Thompson's Law**: Any code that performs sufficiently complex date calculations using na√Øve arithmetic means has a non-zero chance of causing a Y2K-style collapse of the global technology infrastructure.

If your code defines `kSecondsInDay`, `kSecondsInWeek`--or worst of all--`kSecondsInMonth` (seriously, what would you set for that?)... you may want to reconsider. Date and time systems are [really, really complicated](http://infiniteundo.com/post/25326999628/falsehoods-programmers-believe-about-time). Between all of the [time zones](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_time_zones_by_country), [calendars](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_calendars) and other locale-specific information you should be prepared for, you really can't get it right yourself.

Thank `$DEITY` for `NSCalendar` is all I'm saying.

Anyway, this library uses `NSCalendar` and `NSDateComponents` exclusively for date calculation, so you'll handle everything from [leap years](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leap_year) to [leap months](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hebrew_calendar#Leap_months) like a champ.

## Usage

``` objective-c
NSLog(@"Current Time:       %@", date);
NSLog(@"Beginning of Day:   %@", [date beginningOfDay]);
NSLog(@"End of Day:         %@", [date endOfDay]);
NSLog(@"Next Day:           %@", [date nextDay]);
NSLog(@"Previous Day:       %@", [date previousDay]);
NSLog(@"Beginning of Week:  %@", [date beginningOfWeek]);
NSLog(@"End of Week:        %@", [date endOfWeek]);
NSLog(@"Next Week:          %@", [date nextWeek]);
NSLog(@"Previous Week:      %@", [date previousWeek]);
NSLog(@"Beginning of Month: %@", [date beginningOfMonth]);
NSLog(@"End of Month:       %@", [date endOfMonth]);
NSLog(@"Next Month:         %@", [date nextMonth]);
NSLog(@"Previous Month:     %@", [date previousMonth]);
NSLog(@"Beginning of Year:  %@", [date beginningOfYear]);
NSLog(@"End of Year:        %@", [date endOfYear]);
NSLog(@"Next Year:          %@", [date nextYear]);
NSLog(@"Previous Year:      %@", [date previousYear]);
```
